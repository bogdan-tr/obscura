CONFIG ;; do not edit
SEP: [ ] ;; keep empty space between sep

;; INSTRUCTIONS: (you may delete this line and below)

;; you can modify the sep, but don't modify the word SEP:

;; this is a comment, you may delete it

;; HOW REPLACEMENT WORKS:

old -> new ;; old will be replaced with new and surrounded by sep

;; in this case, old will become [new]
;; this is case insensitive, hence
;; Old, OLD and oLD will all become [new]

"replace" -> with ;; this is for case sensitive replacement

delete ;; word with no arrows will simply be deleted

;; EXAMPLES:

;; Feel free to add your own rules! For example:

;; hide your phone number
598 -> num
349 -> num
3499 -> num

;; hide your name
Jacob -> name
Derekson -> lastname

;;hide your private links
https://website.com -> link

;; protect your email
jacob@gmail.com -> email

;; And so much more!
